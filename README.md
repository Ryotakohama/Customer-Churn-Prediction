🔁 ***Customer Churn Prediction Project***  
A machine learning project designed to predict customer churn using historical data, empowering businesses to take proactive retention actions.

🎯 **Objective**  
To develop a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a customer is likely to churn or stay, enabling stakeholders to implement data-driven retention strategies.

🧰 **Technologies Used**  
- 🐍 **Python** – Data Processing, Modeling, Evaluation  
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook** – EDA & ML Workflow  
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Manipulation  
- 📉 **Scikit-learn** – ML Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- 📈 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data Visualization  
- 📂 **CSV Dataset** – Telco Customer Data

🧹 **Data Preprocessing**  
Performed comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing:  
- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries  
- Encoded categorical features (**Label Encoding** & **One-Hot Encoding**)  
- Scaled numerical data (e.g., **tenure**, **monthly charges**)  
- Created new features for better model performance

🔎 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Key analyses include:  
- 📊 **Churn distribution**  
- 💡 **Correlation heatmaps**  
- 👥 **Customer demographics vs churn** (gender, age, etc.)  
- 💳 **Contract types & payment method impact**

🧠 **Machine Learning Models**  
Implemented and compared multiple classification models:  

| **Model**         | **Accuracy** |
|------------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree     | 93%          |
| Random Forest     | 94%          |

- Evaluated using **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**  
- Used **train-test split** and **cross-validation** for robustness

📌 **Key Features Considered**  
- 📞 **Customer Service Calls**  
- 💸 **Monthly & Total Charges**  
- ⌛ **Tenure Duration**  
- 🧾 **Contract Type**  
- 🌐 **Internet Service**

💡 **Business Insights**  
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn  
- Higher churn rates observed for customers with **fiber optic internet**  
- **Short-tenure** and **high monthly charge** customers are at risk  
- **Electronic check** payment method correlated with higher churn
