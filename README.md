# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Churn Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the scenario where customers stop using a company's product or service. The goal is to build a predictive model that helps businesses identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.
